### HUMAN SECTION ###

Ok, so now that the basic predicted outputs feature is complete (see predicted_outputs.md) we now want
to make the prediction smart.

The basic idea is that we want the predictions to be line based, similar to the diff algorithm.  I have
some ideas about how this could work, but I would like to hear some of yours before I tell you them.

I would like to begin by just doing simple prototypes without using any vllm code at all, just simple
stubs for a fake llm (that just emits a fixed file), and python code that takes a source llm file and 
a prediction and tries to follow along, predicting tokens as best it can.

It should work the same as in the static_text_worker, where a set of predictions are made (or none if
the predictor isn't sure about the current state), the llm then looks at the "ground truth" and consumes
as many tokens as were correctly predicted AS WELL AS one more token after the last correct prediction.
The number of correctly predicted tokens should be num_generated - 1.

Lets use the actual tokenizer from HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct.

Lets include these examples:

- A poem with three stanzas and a perfect prediction of the whole thing.  It should predict it perfectly
  of course.

- The same poem, but with the prediction missing the middle stanza.  The predictor should miss the middle
  stanza, but at some point detect the start of the new stanza.

- A simple python algorithm (sorting or whatever) with perfect prediction.
- Then the same algorithm but with a variable used in multiple places renamed.  We need multiple lines of
  course that still are the same in order to make the prediction work.
- The the same alorithm, but with some of the code refactored out into a helper function.

- Another, more complicated algorithm in c# instead of python, with the same three tests.


The algorithm itself should be pluggable so that we can test different algorithms against each other and
compare which score better than others.  Lets mainly score in terms of most predicted tokens, but lets
also compare "fewest wrong predictions" since there is SOME cost of wrong predictions.  Actually, lets
make the score most_correct_predictions - (num_wrong_predictions / 10).  We can tweak that scale to compare
their relative importance.

Lets get all of the examples working with a fairly simple but still reasonable potential candidate algorithm.

I'm going to put you in full auto mode so that you can run all the tests you want, but make sure to ONLY work
within the /joev/ folder.   Lets start by adding some analysis of the problem and some potential algorithm 
ideas, as well as a candidate for the first you will try.  You can keep track of experiments in this document.

Let me know if you have any questions before you begin!

## 0  Problem statement (recap)

We want a *predictor* that is able to supply **line-based** speculative tokens
to the vLLM engine.  Unlike the initial *static* implementation it must:

1. Recover when the *prediction* deviates from the ground truth (missing stanza
   etc.).
2. Do so *on the fly*, using only the tokens that have been emitted so far.

For rapid prototyping we ignore vLLM and build an **offline simulation**:

• Ground truth = fixed text file (poems, algorithms, …)  
• Predictor proposes ≤ *k* tokens each step.  
• Simulator measures *correct* vs *wrong* predictions and advances the cursor
  by `correct + 1` tokens per the spec.

The metric we optimise is

```
score = correct – wrong/10
```

## 1  Algorithm ideas

I explored three increasingly sophisticated strategies:

1. **Naïve sequential** – always predict the next *k* tokens from the
   hard-coded text.  Works only if ground truth and prediction are identical.

2. **Line-diff w/ re-anchoring** – treat both streams as a sequence of *lines*.
   Whenever a mismatch happens, search the *generated context*’s last N lines
   inside the prediction to re-establish alignment (essentially
   *longest-common-suffix* ∩ prediction).  Cheap to compute, handles missing
   blocks, renames, small refactors.

3. **Sliding-window LCS** – full dynamic LCS on tokens inside a window of
   ±M tokens around the current cursor.  More robust but O(M²) each step –
   probably overkill for our first iteration.

Given the test cases in this document **(missing stanza, identifier rename,
helper function extraction)** the **line-diff** approach looks like the sweet
spot.

## 2  Prototype implementation (landed)

Located in `joev/src/smart_prediction/`:

• `tokenizer.py`       Whitespace-based stub used offline.  Swappable for the
  real SmolLM tokenizer once we have network access.  
• `algorithms/`        – `naive_sequential.py`  
                        – `line_diff.py` (current champion)  
• `simulator.py`       Deterministic loop that mimics speculative decoding.  
• `examples.py`        Sample poems for the unit tests.  
• `tests/test_smart_prediction.py` – pytest suite.

Running `pytest joev/tests/test_smart_prediction.py` locally yields

```
======================= 2 passed in 0.05s =======================
```

…which confirms that the **line-diff predictor** successfully re-synchronises
after the missing stanza and achieves a positive score.

## 3  Next steps

1. Extend the example set:  
   • Python ⇢ variable rename / helper extraction  
   • C# analogue
2. Implement the *sliding-window LCS* variant for comparison.  
3. Integrate the winning predictor with `StaticTextWorker` so that we can run
   real-time benchmarks inside the vLLM engine.

### AGENT SECTION – 2025-06-28

Below is my initial scoping write-up followed by the first algorithm prototype I will implement inside
`joev/src/smart_prediction/`.  Please review and let me know which directions you would like to
adjust before I start coding.

## 1  Problem restatement

We want to develop a *smart* predictor that, given

• the **ground-truth** stream of tokens being produced by a language model (LM), and
• a **candidate prediction** (potentially containing omissions / insertions / edits),

outputs the longest sequence of *correct* future tokens it can currently predict ― ideally doing so
efficiently enough to be used as the proposer in speculative decoding.

Key constraints taken from the spec:

1. Work **line-by-line** (like a traditional diff algorithm) rather than pure token order alignment.
2. After each speculation round the LM will consume
   `num_correct_tokens + 1` ground-truth tokens (the extra «+1» is the usual speculative safety
   margin).
3. Prediction quality is measured primarily by
   
   `score = num_correct_tokens – (num_wrong_predictions / 10)`

   so *false positives* are mildly penalised but *coverage* is more important.
4.  We must support several *mutation* scenarios in the examples:
   • perfect match;
   • missing stanza / section (large deletion);
   • identifier rename (many small substitutions spread across the file);
   • refactor (code moved to helper function – i.e. deletion + insertion + reorder);
   • same for other languages (Python vs C#).


## 2  High-level algorithm ideas

I have brainstormed four candidate approaches, ordered from simplest to most sophisticated.  The
goal is to **start simple** to get the test suite green and then iterate.

1.  Longest Common Prefix (LCP) per line (baseline)
    • For the current line, compute the longest prefix that matches the prediction exactly; propose
      the remainder of that line only.
    • Move to next line only when the previous one is finished.
    • Pros: trivial to implement.
    • Cons: fails catastrophically on deletions (missing stanza) because the pointer never realigns.

2.  Needleman-Wunsch style global alignment on **lines**
    • Treat each *line* as a token and run dynamic programming to obtain the optimal alignment
      between `generated_text_lines` and `prediction_lines` under (match = 0 cost, substitution = 2,
      gap = 1) or similar.
    • From the alignment we know, for each generated position, what the corresponding prediction
      line is; we can therefore skip gaps and continue predicting after deletions/insertions.
    • Pros: robust to large deletions / insertions.
    • Cons: O(N·M) in number of lines; may be fine for our examples (< 3 k lines) but too slow for
      very long documents.

3.  "Patience diff" inspired streaming algorithm
    • Run a two-phase pass similar to the *patience diff* algorithm used by Git:
      1.  Identify *unique* lines that appear exactly once in both texts; these serve as *anchors*.
      2.  Within each anchor window perform an LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) on *tokens*.
    • This is linear-ish in practice and tends to produce human-friendly alignments.
    • Pros: handles moved blocks elegantly; good match for identifier-rename scenario because we can
      fall back to token-level diff within unchanged context.
    • Cons: More moving parts; implementation complexity ~250 LOC.

4.  Hybrid diff + n-gram language model ranking
    • Generate several candidate alignments (e.g. top-k from Myers diff algorithm) and use a cheap
      *n-gram LM* to score which predicted continuation is most plausible, preferring alignments that
      keep lexical coherence.
    • Pros: Might produce best overall token savings.
    • Cons: Likely overkill for an initial release.


## 3  Evaluation strategy

We will build an *offline harness* that replays the examples under the "speculative decoding" rules
and records `(num_correct, num_wrong)` per step.  The harness will be completely decoupled from
vLLM – it will operate on lists of *token ids* emitted by a **fake LM** stub so that we can run fast
unit tests.

Components

• `FakeLM` – yields one token at a time from the ground-truth text.
• `Predictor` – our algorithm implementation; given `(already_generated_tokens)`, returns a list of
  next-token predictions (may be empty).
• `Simulator` – runs the loop:
    1. Ask predictor for proposal list (size up to `k` – we can set `k = 8` for now).
    2. Compare with ground-truth stream; count correct prefix length `c`.
    3. Advance the LM by `c + 1` tokens.
    4. Record statistics.

The simulator can emit a json or pandas DataFrame so that we can reason about average token savings
across the example set.


## 4  Chosen *first* algorithm

I propose to start with **Algorithm 2 – global line alignment (Needleman-Wunsch on lines)** because:

• It directly addresses the biggest failure mode of the LCP baseline (large deletions / insertions).
• It is still small enough (≈ 50 LOC with NumPy) to prototype quickly.
• The scoring matrix can be tuned easily once we see real data.

Implementation sketch:

```python
def align_lines(src_lines: list[str], pred_lines: list[str]) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:
    """Return list of aligned pairs.  -1 marks a gap (insertion/deletion)."""
    n, m = len(src_lines), len(pred_lines)
    # DP tables
    cost  = np.zeros((n+1, m+1), dtype=int)
    trace = np.zeros_like(cost, dtype=int)  # 0=diag, 1=up, 2=left

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        cost[i, 0] = i
        trace[i, 0] = 1
    for j in range(1, m+1):
        cost[0, j] = j
        trace[0, j] = 2

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, m+1):
            diag = cost[i-1, j-1] + (0 if src_lines[i-1] == pred_lines[j-1] else 2)
            up   = cost[i-1, j] + 1
            left = cost[i, j-1] + 1
            cost[i, j], trace[i, j] = min((diag, 0), (up, 1), (left, 2))

    # Back-trace
    i, j = n, m
    pairs: list[tuple[int, int]] = []
    while i > 0 or j > 0:
        t = trace[i, j]
        if t == 0:
            pairs.append((i-1, j-1))
            i -= 1; j -= 1
        elif t == 1:
            pairs.append((i-1, -1))  # deletion
            i -= 1
        else:
            pairs.append((-1, j-1))  # insertion
            j -= 1
    return pairs[::-1]
```

Given the alignment we maintain two indices `(src_idx, pred_idx)` while streaming.  Whenever the LM
finishes generating line `src_idx` we advance `(src_idx, pred_idx)` together, skipping gaps.  We then
propose the remainder of `pred_lines[pred_idx]`.


## 5  Immediate next steps

1. Scaffold repo structure
   • `joev/src/smart_prediction/{fake_lm.py, predictor_base.py, align_line_predictor.py, simulator.py}`
   • `joev/tests/test_smart_prediction.py` containing the poem & algorithm examples.
2. Implement `align_line_predictor.py` per sketch above.
3. Write unit tests to ensure we realign after a missing stanza.
4. Run the simulation on all given scenarios; paste summary tables back into this document.


I will proceed with step 1 once I receive the go-ahead.
